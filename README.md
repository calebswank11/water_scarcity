water_scarcity
==============
Please disregard the "eat a bag of dicks" comment. We have listened to a little too much Louis CK and are running on a too little sleep.

Here in the Midwest we have been suffering from a drought for several years now. This drought has dramatically impacted farming and has now started to change our long term outlook for drinkable water. This is a relatively new concern for us but around the world water scarcity is a large problem. 

We decided to create a website that would to address theme #1:

Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. (e.g. climate change, earthquakes, food/water waste, etc.)

And the focus on comprehensive data of water related issues in the world.
